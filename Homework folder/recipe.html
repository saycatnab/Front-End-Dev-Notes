        <h3>Here's what you'll need!</h3>

        <ul> INGREDIENTS
            <li>½ cup sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>4 ounces milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks</li>
            <li>4 ounces dark chocolate chunks (or your preference)</li>

        </ul>




        <ol> PREPARATION
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter <br>
                until a paste has formed with no lumps.</li>
             <br>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, 
                <br>beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk.</li>
             <br>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula,
                <br> being careful not to overmix too much.
                <ul>
                    <li>This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen <br>
                        which will result in cakier cookies</li>
                </ul>
            
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough 
                <br>for at least 30 minutes
            <ul>
                <li>For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, 
                    <br>chill the dough overnight</li>
                <li>The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>

            </ul>
            
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, 
                <br>leaving at least 4 inches of space between cookies and 2 inches of space from the edges
                 <br>of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cool completely, and enjoy!</li>





        </ol>
